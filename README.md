TwitchStreamer Workflow for [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com)
==============================

## Summary
* Search Twitch.tv streams and watch in [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) or [mpv](https://mpv.io/) ([Livestreamer](https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer) required)

* keywords: `tw`, `twtop`, `twgames`, optional: `twbygame`, `twcover`

* `twtop`: show top live streams on twitch.tv

* `twgames`: show top live games streamed on twitch.tv

* `tw`: search specific live stream/game on twitch.tv (argument: game, channel or streamer)

* `twbygame`: search streams by game, result leads to `tw `

* `twcover`: download game icons/covers/posters (optional, you only have to use it once you want to download many new game covers => e.g. because you deleted your outdated cover-folder)

* browse philosophy: `twtop` or `twgames` for getting the most wanted streams on twitch.tv

* search philosophy: `tw star` finds streamer like "starman" and "starcraft"-games streams


## Details

Check who is streaming on Twitch.Tv (category gaming) and watch your favorite stream via [Livestreamer](https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer) on [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) or [mpv](https://mpv.io/) (no lags anymore, thanks to buffering).

The main keyword is `tw` and the second word is the game or stream you want to watch (examples: `tw voyboy` or `tw league of legends` or also simply `tw league`). Alternative: Use keyword `twtop` to see the current TOP streams or `twgames` for the current TOP streamed games. Limit of streams is changable via specific workflow ($limit-variable).

With `enter` you can open the stream via [Livestreamer](https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer) on [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) or [mpv](https://mpv.io/). 

The streamer list is sorted by number of viewers descending. The quality of the stream is "high". If you want to change it to best (e.g.), feel free to open the existing "Terminal Command" (alfred, workflow-window) and modify the Livestreamer line.

Optional: If you deleted your game icons/covers/posters folder (because many of them are outdated) you should use `twcover` to download all the top game covers. Otherwise `tw ` or `twtop` will do it, but it takes more time and downloads less covers.

#Changelog

## 1.82

* Changed streaming quality to Best (from High), because many streams will not work with High as default quality.
* Added new game covers.

## 1.81

* Updated jdfwarriors workflows.php for Alfred 3 support (fixed warnings), updated github project link to a generic one.

## 1.8

* Updated OneUpdater (thx@ vitorgalvao), replaced NSAppleScript by a normal RunScript(JS) that handles the latest installed Alfred (no matter if we switch to Alfred 4..5..6 in future), fixed connection issues by changing file_put_contents to curl and extending url_get_contents().

## 1.75

* Added [`OneUpdater`](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/master/OneUpdater) ([forum post](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/9224-oneupdater-â€”-update-workflows-with-a-single-node/)) that allows you to update the workflow out of the box (it checks for updates automatically every 15 days and downloads/opens new versions). Changed the usage of Terminal to Run Script (no opened terminal any longer during watching stream). Thx@ vitorgalvao.

## 1.74

* Replaced file_get_contents() by an own created url_get_contents() that is using curl. It seems file_get_contents(): https:// wrapper is disabled in the server configuration by allow_url_fopen=0 on the new macOS Sierra.

TwitchStreamer Workflow for [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com)
==============================

## Summary
* Search Twitch.tv streams and watch via [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) or [mpv](https://mpv.io/) or [IINA](https://iina.io) ([Streamlink (former Livestreamer)](https://streamlink.github.io/index.html) required)

* keywords: `tw`, `twtop`, `twgames`, optional: twcover`

* `twtop`: show top live streams (sorted by number of current viewers)

* `twgames`: show top live games streamed (sorted by number of current viewers)

* `tw`: search specific live channel/game

* `twcover`: download/preload game icons for better user experience

* browse philosophy: `twtop` or `twgames` for getting the most wanted streams on twitch.tv

* search philosophy: `tw star` finds streamer like "starman" and "starcraft"-games streams


## Details

Check who is streaming on Twitch.tv (category gaming) and watch your favorite stream via [Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/index.html) on [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) or [mpv](https://mpv.io/) or [IINA](https://iina.io) (no lags anymore, thanks to buffering).

The main keyword is `tw` and the second word is the game or stream you want to watch (examples: `tw voyboy` or `tw league of legends` or also simply `tw league`). Alternative: Use keyword `twtop` to see the current TOP streams or `twgames` for the current TOP streamed games. Limit of streams is changable via specific workflow ($limit-variable).

With `enter` you can open the stream via [Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/index.html) on [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) or [mpv](https://mpv.io/) or [IINA](https://iina.io). 

The streamer list is sorted by number of viewers descending. The quality of the stream is "high". If you want to change it to best (e.g.), feel free to open the existing "Terminal Command" (alfred, workflow-window) and modify the streamlink line.

Optional: If you deleted your game icons/covers folder (because many of them are outdated) you should use `twcover` to download all the top game covers. Otherwise `tw ` or `twtop` will do it, but it takes more time and downloads less covers at the same time.
